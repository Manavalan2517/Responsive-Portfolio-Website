### Overview

The `Home` component is the main entry point for the website. It renders a series of child components that provide information about the website's services, portfolio, testimonials, and contact information.

### Structure

The `Home` component is a functional component that returns a `div` element containing the following child components:

* **Hero:** A component that displays a hero image and tagline.
* **About:** A component that provides information about the website or company.
* **Services:** A component that displays a list of the website's services.
* **Counter:** A component that displays a series of counters showcasing statistics.
* **Portfolio:** A component that displays a gallery of the website's projects or work.
* **Testimonials:** A component that displays testimonials from satisfied clients.
* **Blog:** A component that displays recent blog posts.
* **Contact:** A component that provides a contact form or information.

### Functionality

The `Home` component does not have any specific functionality beyond rendering its child components. The logic and functionality of each child component is handled within those components themselves. The `Home` component acts as a container for all these components, organizing them into a cohesive and informative homepage.
