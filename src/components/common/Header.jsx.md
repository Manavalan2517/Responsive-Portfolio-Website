### Header Component Overview

This component renders the header of the application. It includes the following elements:

- **Logo:** Displays the application logo.
- **Navigation Menu:** Contains links to different sections of the application.
- **Responsive Menu Toggle:** A button that displays a dropdown menu on smaller screens.

### Component Functionality

#### Scroll Behavior

- The header uses `useEffect` to track the user's scroll position.
- The `handleScroll` function updates the `isVisible` state based on the scroll position.
- `isVisible` controls the header's visibility and animation:
  - If the user scrolls down or the scroll position is less than 10 pixels, the header is visible and translated to `y: 0`.
  - If the user scrolls up and the scroll position is greater than 10 pixels, the header is translated to `y: -full` and effectively hidden.

#### Responsive Menu Toggle

- The `handleMenuClick` function toggles the `responsive` state, which controls the visibility of the responsive menu.
- The `handleLinkClick` function closes the responsive menu when a link is clicked.

#### Menu Animation

- The navigation menu and the responsive menu both use `framer-motion` to animate their appearance.
- Both menus use the following animation properties:
  - **Initial:** `opacity: 0` and `y: -20` (hidden and translated upwards)
  - **Animate:** 
    - `isVisible: true` or `responsive: true`:  `opacity: 1` and `y: 0` (visible and translated to the normal position)
    - `isVisible: false` or `responsive: false`: `opacity: 0` and `y: -20` (hidden and translated upwards)
  - **Transition:**
    - `duration: 0.3` (animation duration is 300ms)
    - `delay: isVisible ? i * 0.1 : 0` or `delay: responsive ? i * 0.1 : 0`: Each menu item has a staggered delay based on its index, creating a smoother animation. 

The animations create a smooth and engaging user experience when the user scrolls or interacts with the menu.
